A tool for automatic creation of nginx configs for PHP hosts
============================

Simply edit `create_site_simple.sh` to change default values like `WEB_DIR` or `IP`.
Probably you are have a non-default directory for nginx installation. Then you need to edit 
`NGINX_CONFIG` and `NGINX_SITES_ENABLED`.

Used in conjunction with properly installed and configured [nensite tool](https://github.com/xufan6/nensite)
